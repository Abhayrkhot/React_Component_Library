# React Component Library

A fully customizable and production-ready **React + TypeScript Component Library** built for scalability, reusability, and team collaboration. This library empowers frontend teams to rapidly build consistent UIs with shared design patterns, powerful tooling, and first-class documentation.

---

## Key Features

### Built with TypeScript
- All components are typed with TypeScript for strong typing, autocomplete, and developer safety.
- Ensures compatibility with both TypeScript and JavaScript projects.

### Rollup Bundling
- Uses Rollup for optimized builds with support for ESM and CommonJS outputs.
- Produces tree-shakable and minified output to ensure minimal bundle sizes in production apps.

### Storybook Integration
- Full integration with Storybook for isolated component development and documentation.
- Enables visual testing, prop controls, and interaction simulation.
- Easily shareable static documentation via `storybook-static`.

### Theming and Customization
- Components are built to be theme-aware and customizable through props, contexts, or tokens.
- Ready for design system integrations with support for utility-first or token-based styling.

### ESLint & Prettier Setup
- Enforces clean code practices via `.eslintrc.json` and Prettier.
- Pre-configured for formatting consistency, unused imports cleanup, and TypeScript-specific linting.

### Testing-Ready Structure
- The architecture supports the easy addition of unit tests using Jest or React Testing Library (not preconfigured but compatible).
- Encourages test-driven development for components and hooks.

### Commit Linting + Husky Hooks
- Ensures conventional commit messages via Commitlint.
- Includes Husky for pre-commit hooks that run linters/tests before pushing, increasing code quality and CI safety.

### CI/CD Configuration
- Ready-to-use GitHub Actions and CircleCI pipelines for:
  - Build validation
  - Lint checks
  - Storybook deployment
  - Version bumping and changelogs

### Modular File Structure
- Scalable `src/` layout with folders for:
  - `components/`
  - `hooks/`
  - `utils/`
- Encourages separation of concerns and team ownership.
